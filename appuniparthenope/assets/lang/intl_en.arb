    "villa_doria": "Villa Doria d’Angri is one of the most important neoclassical villas in Italy.  The villa, majestically perched on a tuffaceous spur of the Posillipo hill, was built by the will of Prince Marcantonio Doria d’Angri, the last prominent member of the noble Genoese family. Within a vast plot of land, partly steep and rugged, partly gently sloping along the ridge, the leisure residence was meant to have an imposing character, befitting the prestigious role the prince held at court during those years.   The Doria estate extended along the ridge of the hill down to the Mergellina beach, with terraces of vineyards and fruit trees. The property was donated to the noble family in 1592 by Vittoria Carafa and transformed from a farmhouse into a neoclassical princely residence by architect Bartolomeo Grasso, completed in 1833. It also serves as a tangible symbol of the Doria family's rank and maritime traditions. After Prince Marcantonio's death in 1837, it was rented out and later sold in 1857 to the noble Englishwoman Ellinor Giovanna Susanna Maitland.   Since 1998, the building has been part of the University of Naples 'Parthenope's' real estate assets and is dedicated to advanced education, national and international scientific conferences, and cultural events. It also houses the valuable collection of static ship models, parts of merchant and military vessels, nautical instruments, and equipment preserved in the Naval Museum.",
