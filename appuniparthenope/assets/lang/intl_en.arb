  "villa_doria": "Villa Doria d'Angri is one of the most important neoclassical villas in Italy. The villa, majestically located on a tufa spur on the Posillipo hill, was built by the prince Marcantonio Doria d'Angri, the last prominent representative of the noble Genoese family. It was designed with a grand and aristocratic character, fitting the prince's prestigious role at court.\n\nThe Doria estate extended along the hill’s crest down to the Mergellina beach, with terraced vineyards and fruit trees. The property came into the Doria family’s possession in 1592 by donation from Vittoria Carafa, and it was transformed from a farm into a neoclassical princely residence by architect Bartolomeo Grasso and completed in 1833.\n\nAfter Prince Marcantonio's death in 1837, it was rented out and later, in 1857, sold to the noble Englishwoman Ellinor Giovanna Susanna Maitland. The building became part of the University of Naples Parthenope’s real estate in 1998 and is now used for advanced education, national and international scientific conferences, and cultural events. It also houses the valuable collection of static models of ships and parts of merchant and military vessels, nautical instruments, and equipment preserved in the Naval Museum.",
